        <p class="lead">I'm a front-end web developer based in Tarzana, California. I also have some familiarity with LAMP stack back end technologies. Currently, I'm focused on rich internet applications with a minimal back end.</p>

        <p class="lead">Before I was a web developer, I was a graphic artist and marketing assistant. Before that I was a journalist for three years. Both experiences gave me plenty of opportunities to create visual content like flyers, brochures and newsletters.</p>

        <p class="lead">In my spare time I love to read and write short stories. I also enjoy watching and occasionally participating in improv theater. If you want to talk about coding, or just how many cool things there are to do in LA, send me an email at <a href='mailto:joshualopez1985@gmail.com'>joshualopez1985@gmail.com</a></p>
