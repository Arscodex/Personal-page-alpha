# Ball-Jump

This game, currently in a playable prototype stage, will eventually have several variations on board games with a ball jump mechanic. In these games, a ball cannot move unless it has an adjacent ball to jump over, and in doing so it removes the jumped ball from the board. 

##Version 1.0

The first version is meant to develop the mechanics and interface. Clicking on a ball turns it from silver to gold to highlight it, and red squares on the gameboard appear to show legal moves. 

###Lessons Learned in This Version

##Future Versions

The game has a lot of potential for additional mechanics. A password feature could allow players to jump ahead levels. There also needs to be far more levels overall, as there are only a handful in v1.0. Some planned features: 

1. A Level Editor accessible by players. The levels are saved in a cloud-hosted database. 
2. An 'expert' mode with variations on the game elements. 
3. 'Solid' game pieces that don't disappear when jumped. 
4. 'Tough' game pieces that take more than one jump to destroy. 
5. 'Migration', a game mode where the objective is to move balls to a certain area. 
6. A hints system. 
7. Some kind of achievement system that unlocks additional features for custom level design. 

###Goals

At least 30 levels of progressive challenge. Additional game modes and game pieces. 

There should be potential for player-driven content. Custom levels should have a rating system for challenge level, as well as a playcount of how many times it has been played.
